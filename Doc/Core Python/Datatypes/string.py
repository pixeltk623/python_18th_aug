# Strings
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# 'hello' is the same as "hello".

# You can display a string literal with the print() function:

# print("Hello")
# print('Hello')

# a = "hello"

# print(a)

# a = """cdsa
# asdasdas
# asdasdassdasd
# asdasdsa"""

# print(a)

a = 'Hello, World'

# print(a[1])

# for x in a:
# 	print(x)

# print(len(a))

# print("Hello" in a)


# print("hello" not in a)

print(a[1:2])
